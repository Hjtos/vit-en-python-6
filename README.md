## Exception Handling Assignment 1: Robust Calculator App

### Objective: Build a simple calculator app that handles various exceptions gracefully.

### Tasks:
- Write functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Implement input validation and error handling to manage non-numeric inputs and division by zero errors.
- Provide user-friendly error messages and allow the user to correct their inputs.


## Exception Handling Assignment 2: Robust User Input Parser

### Objective: Create a script that asks the user to input numbers and performs calculations, while handling various input-related exceptions.

### Tasks:
-	Prompt the user to input a series of numbers, separated by commas.
-	Write a function to parse these numbers and calculate their sum and average.
-	Implement exception handling for scenarios such as invalid input (non-numeric values), empty input, or improper formatting (like missing commas).
-	In case of an exception, display a user-friendly error message and give the user a chance to re-enter the data correctly.


## Modules and Packages Assignment 1: Create and Use Your Own Module

### Objective: Develop a custom Python module and then use it in a separate Python script.

### Tasks:
1.	Creating the Module:
   - Develop a module named utilities.py.
   - Inside this module, write at least three useful functions. For example, a function to calculate the factorial of a number, another to check if a number is prime, and a third one to generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a given number.
   - 	Add proper documentation (docstrings) to each function explaining its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
2. Using the Module:
- Create a separate Python script named main.py.
- In this script, import your utilities module.
- Use the functions from the utilities module to perform different tasks. For example, ask the user to input a number and then calculate and display the factorial of that number, check if it’s prime, and display the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
- Ensure that the user inputs are validated and handled appropriately.


## Modules and Packages Assignment 2: Creating a Dice Simulator using Python’s Random Module

### Objective:
To build a simple dice simulator that generates random dice rolls, utilizing your knowledge of Python modules and packages.

### Task Description:

1.	Module Exploration:
	- Begin by researching the random module in Python. Understand its purpose and explore the different functions it offers.
2.	Dice Simulator Program:
	- Write a Python program called dice_simulator.py.
	- Your program should simulate the rolling of a standard six-sided dice.
	- Use the randint() function from the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 6, inclusive. This represents the dice roll.
p3.	User Interaction:
	- Allow the user to roll the dice by inputting a command, like pressing ‘r’ or ‘roll’.
	- After each roll, display the outcome to the user.
	- Ask the user if they would like to roll again. The program should continue until the user decides to stop.
4.	Enhancements (Optional):
	- Enhance your simulator by adding the functionality to simulate different types of dice (e.g., 4-sided, 8-sided, etc.).
	- Implement error handling for invalid user inputs.
	- Add comments to your code explaining your logic.
